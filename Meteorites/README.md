Meteorites is an application of [Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter). The project consists of two parts, in first part we need to predict the future location of the meteorites using Kalman Filter given the historic meteorite locations while they are moving towards Earth. In second part, given the ability to predict future location of the meteorites, we can turn our laser turret to the appropriate angle to destroy meteorites before they hit Earth.

The grey dots are meteorites, and the red line is laser.

This is a project in CS 7638 Robotics: AI Techniques class.
